    Create Cousine

        i. Requirement:

            Recipe has a Cousine attribute to categorize recipes based on their culinary origin (e.g., Italian, Mexican, Chinese). So that users can filter and explore recipes by their preferred Cousine type.

        ii. Decision: 

            1. Store cousine information as a dedicated master records with below user inputs.

                User inputs: name, description (optional) - as per standard fields, but optional because existing data may not have description.

            2. Implement CRUD operations for Cousine master records.

                - Create: Add a new Cousine record to the database.
                - Read: Retrieve existing Cousine records from the database.
                - Update: Modify an existing Cousine record in the database.
                - Delete: Remove a Cousine record from the database.

        iii. Master Table creation

            Table Name: m_cousine

            Fields:

                1. id (Primary Key, Auto-increment)

                2. name (Varchar(100), Unique, Not Null)

                3. description (Text, Optional)

                4. created_at (Timestamp, Default: Current Timestamp), created_by (Foreign Key to Users table), updated_at (Timestamp, Default: Current Timestamp on Update), updated_by (Foreign Key to Users table), delFlag (Boolean, Default: False)

        iv. Relationships

            1. One-to-Many relationship with Recipe table (One Cousine can have many Recipes)
